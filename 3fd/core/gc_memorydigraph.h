/*
    Here is implemented a directed graph tuned for reachability analysis used by the garbage collector.
    In this graph, each vertex is either a safe pointer or a piece of garbage collected memmory (which
    might contain a safe pointer inside it). The vertices are distinguished as regular or root. A root
    vertex is a safe pointer allocated in memory not managed by the garbage collector. That means client
    code uses such pointers to access the remaining of the graph (garbage collected memory pieces),    that
    are the regular vertices.

    This distinction is central for the GC to perform reachability analysis. When a given piece of memory
    is not connected to any root vertex, that means it became out of reach and has to be collected. This
    approach is not vulnerable to cyclic references, unlike reference counting.
